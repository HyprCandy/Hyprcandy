# HyprCandy
HyprCandy is a feature rich Hyprland configuretion for Arch and Arch-based distributions with sytemwide color generation for GTK and QT6 applications plus other Hyprland elements along with other other quality of life settings.

It took ages to learn how to set up everything during my free time since I'm not a programmer. It's been a little stressful, but I guess I got stressed so you wouldn't. If you like this, I'd appreciate your show of [appreciation](https://ko-fi.com/ianmking)  ðŸ™‚.

You can checkout the little showcase below or head on over to the installation repo [here](https://github.com/HyprCandy/hyprcandyinstall).
